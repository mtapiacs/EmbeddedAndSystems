# Musical Instrument
* __Action:__ Takes input from membrane keypad and outputs musical notes through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and a passive
  buzzer. The project works with 12 notes in octaves 1, 3, 5, and 7. The octave can be changed through the letters (A-D)
  on the membrane keypad. This prototype also displays frequency intensity in the respective octave through a matrix display.
  Additionally, there are colored LEDs displaying change between octaves.
* __Built With:__ Arduino C++
* __Developed:__ Embedded Programming, Binary Representation
